	journal = {Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter},
	abstract = {The authors present a model for the superconducting states of UPt3 in which a two-dimensional order parameter couples to a field that breaks the hexagonal symmetry of the crystal. This symmetry-breaking field (SBF) splits the superconducting transition, leading to two superconducting phases in zero field. The high-temperature superconducting phase exhibits the broken hexagonal symmetry of the SBF, while the low-temperature phase spontaneously breaks time-reversal symmetry. The authors calculate the specific heat jumps at both transitions and compare with the recent measurements by Fisher et al. They find that sizeable strong-coupling corrections are needed to explain the magnitude of the heat capacity jumps and the splitting of the transition. They show that a kink in the upper critical field occurs for fields in the basal plane. Comparison of the discontinuity in the slope of Hc2(T) with the data of Taillefer et al. (on a different UPt3 crystal) is in qualitative agreement with the heat capacity data. They also predict a change in slope of Hcl(T) at the temperature of the second peak in the heat capacity, for all field orientations. Observation of all three features in the same single crystal would provide convincing evidence for unconventional pairing in UPt3 and would be a stringent test of the model presented.}

	abstract = {The exotic superconductor UPt3 has two superconducting phases that appear at different temperatures, but their nature remains unclear. Schemm et al. shone circularly polarized light on a crystal of UPt3 and studied its reflection (see the Perspective by van der Marel and Sawatzky). In the low-temperature phase, the pairs of electrons that make the material superconducting have a handedness to them. The finding narrows down the possible descriptions of the electron-pair wave function.Science, this issue p. 190; see also p. 138Models of superconductivity in unconventional materials can be experimentally differentiated by the predictions they make for the symmetries of the superconducting order parameter. In the case of the heavy-fermion superconductor UPt3, a key question is whether its multiple superconducting phases preserve or break time-reversal symmetry (TRS). We tested for asymmetry in the phase shift between left and right circularly polarized light reflected from a single crystal of UPt3 at normal incidence and found that this so-called polar Kerr effect appears only below the lower of the two zero-field superconducting transition temperatures. Our results provide evidence for broken TRS in the low-temperature superconducting phase of UPt3, implying a complex two-component order parameter for superconductivity in this system.},

    ABSTRACT={Recent theories of Sr<sub>2</sub>RuO<sub>4</sub> based on the interplay of strong interactions, spin-orbit coupling and multi-band anisotropy predict chiral or helical ground states with strong anisotropy of the pairing states, with deep minima in the excitation gap, as well as strong phase anisotropy for the chiral ground state. We develop time-dependent mean field theory to calculate the Bosonic spectrum for the class of 2D chiral superconductors spanning <sup>3</sup>He-A to chiral superconductors with strong anisotropy. Chiral superconductors support a pair of massive Bosonic excitations of the time-reversed pairs labeled by their parity under charge conjugation. These modes are degenerate for 2D <sup>3</sup>He-A. Crystal field anisotropy lifts the degeneracy. Strong anisotropy also leads to low-lying Fermions, and thus to channels for the decay of the Bosonic modes. Selection rules and phase space considerations lead to large asymmetries in the lifetimes and hybridization of the Bosonic modes with the continuum of un-bound Fermion pairs. We also highlight results for the excitation of the Bosonic modes by microwave radiation that provide clear signatures of the Bosonic modes of an anisotropic chiral ground state.}

This is exemplified in superfluid 3He which has multiple thermodynamic phases with spin and orbital quantum numbers S = 1 and L = 1, that emerge on cooling from a nearly ferromagnetic Fermi liquid. The heavy fermion compound UPt3 exhibits similar behavior clearly manifest in its multiple superconducting phases. However, consensus as to its order parameter symmetry has remained elusive. Our small angle neutron scattering measurements indicate a linear temperature dependence of the London penetration depth characteristic of nodal structure of the order parameter. Our theoretical analysis is consistent with assignment of its symmetry to an L = 3 odd parity state for which one of the three thermodynamic phases in non-zero magnetic field is chiral.}
